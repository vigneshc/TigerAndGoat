[Lambs and Tigers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambs_and_Tigers) is an abstract strategy board game.

This project contains an implementation of the game as a learning exercise in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and  [AspNet core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-2.1). There is no server side logic, it can as well be a static html app. Dotnet core was chosen just for convenience as it creates initial boiler plate code.
